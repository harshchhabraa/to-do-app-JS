// Adding all points that we have considered for building the todo app

1.Add feature
a)button click?
when i click on a button it must call some function, and this function contains the add logic

Button-source
Click-event
Action-function(){}

2.When Add functions calls, it does the following
2.1
a) read the fields
b)validate the fields, if the validation is correct so it will store the value
Id, name, desc, photo;, date, time- so it means it is an object
Object=record
I need multiple records(task) so it means array of objects

2.2 Now print the record(object). eg for in loop dynamically tr and td build

2.3 Show the totals, array length
